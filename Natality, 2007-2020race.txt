Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"2. Single Race categories are not available for births before year 2016. Maternal single race data for years before 2016 are"
"recoded to the Single Race category ""Not Available"". More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality.html#About-Single-Race."
"3. Beginning in 2017, due to state statutory restrictions, California no longer provides record-level data on the marital status"
"of the mother for births occurring in California to California residents and non-residents (including residents of other"
"states). For these births, Marital Status is coded as ""Not Reported."""
